## Contributing

Thank you for wanting to improve PMT Buddy! This is mainly my personal project to help develop my programming skills but I am open to contributions.

### Building

- Download required libraries with `npm install`
- Debug with `npm run watch`
- Build with `npm run build`, then zip the contents of the `build` folder.

### Extension structure

- `public` contains the `manifest.json`, `popup.html`, and any other assets used for the HTML.
- `src` contains CSS and JS files.
    - `modules` contains folders for each of the websites, and `index.js` runs each feature.
    - `utils` has some helper classes and functions.
    - `background.js` is the service worker.
    - `contentScript.js` redirects to `./modules/index.js`.
    - `popup.js` is run when the extension popup is opened.
